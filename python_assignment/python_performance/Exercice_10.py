# Some answers to the question
# Efficient Array Operations:
# NumPy provides a powerful n-dimensional array object that allows for efficient
# and optimized array operations. It is implemented in C,
# which allows for low-level memory management and optimized computations,
# resulting in faster execution compared to pure Python.

# Vectorization: NumPy encourages vectorized operations,
# which means performing operations on entire arrays instead of
# individual elements. This approach leverages optimized C
# and assembly code under the hood to process the data in parallel,
# leading to significant speed improvements.
