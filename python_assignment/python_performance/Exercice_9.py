# Multithreading in Python is often less effective at improving performance compared
# to other languages due to a few limitations and factors inherent to the Python language
# and its Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL is a mechanism in CPython (the reference
# implementation of Python) that ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode
# at a time.
# The GIL in CPython allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time,
# even on multi-core systems. This means that multithreaded Python programs
# cannot fully utilize multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks.
# The GIL prevents true parallel execution of multiple threads,
# limiting performance gains in CPU-bound scenarios.
